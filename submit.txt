HOW TO SUBMIT A PROGRAM HARD COPY FOR CS326
===========================================

All programs submitted for grading in CS326 must be printed from Linux 
on one of the printers in AC212 using gedit.  This is required.  
Programs printed anywhere else will not be graded and will be returned 
to the student for correction and will be considered late.  The 
program must be printed from the folder where the C language source is 
to be placed for grading.  That is, do not print the program until it 
is in place for grading.  Before printing, the following changes are 
required to be made to gedit.

Click the down arrow at the upper left next to gedit, and select Preferences:

1. View tab:
         Check: the first 3 boxes
       Uncheck: everything else

2. Editor tab:

         Check: Insert spaces instead of tabs
       Uncheck: everything else

3. Fonts & Colors tab:

Select the menu (3 bars at the upper right) then select the printer (middle) icon.
